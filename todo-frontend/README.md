# Todo - Remember Everything

React-based web app that helps users keep track of day-to-day tasks effectively and efficiently.

### What can a user do with this?
Todo - Remember everything, maintains a local copy of the tasks added by the user on their local machine. A user can do things like: -
<ul>
    <li>Add a new todo</li>
    <li>Update or edit an existing todo</li>
    <li>Delete an existing todo</li>
    <li>Sort todos based on their ids</li>
</ul>

The App is device responsive and can be used independently on different kinds of devices.

[ Note: - As the todos list is not synced, the data availablity is scoped to a given device. ]
